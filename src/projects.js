        description: <p>AntAlert is a web application that was built with Firebase, Express, React, and Node. I built this web app with a friend during summer '23 to combat the difficulty of constantly checking the schedule of classes for an open spot in courses. We came up with this idea after I couldn't get a spot in a major course for missing the date when restrictions lifted :&#40;<br />I'm sure many UCI students would find this useful as the constant scrambling and reloading between the webreg portal and verifying your course on the schedule is not only tedious but also anxiety-inducing (at least for me). </p>,

ZotnFound is a platform designed for UCI students, allowing them to effortlessly locate and recover lost or found items, ensuring their safe return.  The idea for this application came as my team and I were thinking about what we should create that could help the student community better, and we were reminded of an instance where one of our friends had lost a hydroflask (which are pretty expensive) and she couldn't find it again. This could be because of the lack of support and resources for lost items. <br /><br /> We are currently planning to make this into a mobile app and work on the frontend for a cleaner interface.</p>,

        description: <p>1st Place at UCI ICSSC WebJam 2022 ü•áüèÜ. Zotpals is a website that allows students to borrow donated items and build long-lasting connections with one another. This application was built using the MERN stack and was our very first time working with databases and React. The idea behind this application was to help students have more resources and access to small things that they might need but are in a time crunch or special circumstances. <br /> We plan to restructure the UI of the application since it was all done in plain HTML/CSS because we weren't aware of UI frameworks like ChakraUI, MUI, and others. However, it was a good learning experience to create our own styles and componetns from scratch.</p>,

I think it was a pretty interesting project to work with as there are a bunch of similar sites online that were popular. Understanding how it functions showed me that I can do it myself within a couple days. <br />I'm super excited for my future projects and hoping to dive into React Native or Flutter to create mobile applications and hopefully look into creating and designing gaming apps. </p>,

The main data structure is just an array that keeps track of the pattern and checks the user's pattern against the correct one.

I still want to be able to create the same layout in pure HTML/CSS by myself though. </p>,
